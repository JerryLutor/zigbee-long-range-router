# cod.m CC2530+CC2592 Long Range ZigBee Router
Here are the Eagle board files and schematic of cod.m's [Zigbee Long Range Router](https://shop.codm.de/automation/zigbee/23/zigbee-cc2530-cc2592-long-range-router/repeater) based on EByte's E18-MS1PA1-IPX sporting an CC2530 combined with an CC2592 PA/LNA for range extension.

The corresponding eagle library for the EByte modules can be found here: https://github.com/codm/eagle-libraries

You can buy a ready built router, including external antenna and power supply at our webshop: https://shop.codm.de

# Firmware
Thanks to https://ptvo.info and his [configurable ZigBee Firmware](https://ptvo.info/zigbee-switch-configurable-firmware-v2-210/), we've built our own version - based on Z-Stack 1.2 - of the firmware to make use of the onboard LED.

## Upgrading
You can flash the module with a new firmware using an CC-Debugger from TI, as also used for the common CC2531-USB-Sticks.

# Case
We also designed a neat 3D printed case. The design files are available on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4192704
